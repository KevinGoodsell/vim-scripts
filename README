ABOUT
-----

This is a collection of Vim scripts I've written, released as free
software.

SCRIPTS
-------

plugin/indent.vim

  Detects the indent style for files being edited and sets options
  accordingly. This does a fairly good job of detecting files using
  spaces, tabs, or a combination of the two for indentation.

plugin/vcsdiff.vim

  Commands for viewing diffs of files in version control systems. Uses
  Vim's internal diff mechanism to show differences between the edited
  version of a file and checked-in versions. Currently supports Git,
  Mercurial, and Subversion.

plugin/runline.vim

  Command for evaluating a line as Python code, writing the result into
  the buffer. Useful for quick calculations.

plugin/hexedit.vim

  Simple command to add a hex-editing mode.

plugin/fmtwarn.vim

  Plugin to highlight common formatting problems.

plugin/autoclog.vim

  A tool to log autocmd executions, allowing plugin writers to see what
  autocmds are being executed and in what order.

plugin/gpgsecure.vim

  Plugin for securely editing files encrypted with GnuPG. Similar to
  gnupg.vim, but much simpler and (I believe) more secure.

gpgpsecure.vimrc

  Vim configuration file for use with gpgsecure.vim.

syntax/hashes.vim

  Syntax file for hash files, like those created by md5sum, sha1sum,
  etc. Designed to help with comparing sets of files.

scripts.vim

  Syntax detection file for use with syntax/hashes.vim.
